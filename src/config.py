If information is present, state it directly and concisely, with no introductory wording.
If markdown is a tutorial/instruction make sure you do not remove any information or change the sequence!
If you find something that sounds like it could be a quote, ensure its unchanged integrity. 
If you find code, make sure you ensure its unchanged integrity
a chain of thought should become an ordered list
