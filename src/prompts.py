> Today i will meet a happy person, a sad person, a calm person and an angry person.  
> What i do or say only offers them an opportunity to express what is already inside of them, not causing it

Do not make yourself responsible for another persons reactions. They are mostly rooted in how they felt before it happened anyway.

> Do not take on another persons anger, do not take on another persons fears. They have to resolve those themselves and trying to take it from them is a disservice to the continued maturing of their character, forcing them to live mediocre lifes just for a moment of comfort.

Same principle but different angle. Taking responsibility for another persons anger, pain and fears is not a nice thing to do. it hurts them in the long run.

> We have two brains, a thinking brain and a feeling brain.  
> Each person predominantly uses the one that they are more comfortable with.  
> It doesn't make either better than the other, it is just their preference.  
> Feeling is fast and in the moment, thinking is slow and longterm.

Both are needed, but for different things. Never make longterm decisions from on emotional standpoint and don't overthink in moments that require a fast response and action.

> If you try and fail, you fail once. If you compromise and fail, you fail twice.

Just try. Fail once at most.

> Always consider the source of the information before you remember it as a fact

Example - watched some angry feminist rant on about how the placenta that extracts nutrients from the mothers body is made up only of the mans DNA - well would you look at that, it's wrong... Guess who should have remembered that angry women never fact-check...

> Becoming self-employed is simple, just sell something.

Then repeat forever or until rich enough. (whatever that means)

> Will tomorrow be easier or harder to start based on waht you did today?

This is my new metric on wether or not I did well today. If it made tomorrow easier to do then I did well. If tomorrow is harder because of the things I did not do today, that makes today (to a degree) a failure that needs correction tomorrow.

> Reduce Input and Output rises
> Increase Input and Output declines

A simple proportionality of the human mind. You can't talk while you swallow and you can't swallow without stopping talking. If you can't control your output, control your input and output will take care of itself.

> Messaging someone after work with work issues is the equivalent of running to their house, knocking on their door in a crazed manner while ringing their doorbell to tell them about a problem they will need to solve tomorrow.

If you wouldn't interrupt your day to do that, why do you text them expecting them to interrupt theirs?

> Take 1-2 days of digital input as fertilizer, then stay the fuck away from the digital for the other 5 days and digest and use what you found.

Nothing to add here. I think 1:2.5 is a good ratio

> Sadness makes me creative
> Pain makes me learn
> Anger makes me act

Therefore there is no negative emotion. All bring value in different ways.

> There are two types of "depressions".
> The one where you are empty or in pain.
> The one where you are doubting yourself, the circumstances or where you are right now.
> Next time you feel like you are in a dark place ask yourself
> Do I need a break and do things to recharge and recover myself? Or do I need to take actions that give me easy wins and built my trust and confidence again?

Sometimes you think about where you should be and contrast it with where you are and then project how far it is and how late you are and how behind it feels. Shut the fuck up. Trust the process. Do the thing. If you stop now to feel bad about how behind you are you will fall further behind. Keep doing it. Progress is not linear, it is parabolic. Keep. Going.

> Stop reacting, stop correcting, stop projecting - build evolving systems, not perfection and let others make mistakes.

> Will tomorrow be easier or harder based on my actions today?
> And how far do they carry forward?

> Quotes are more intense because they are distilled to a singular line.

They are oneliners vs my mindset paragraphs.
Got to get down to distilling my mindset paragraphs sooner or later

> Your castle only is as stable as the one who is holding up its foundations

If your lifes quality depends on a single person and that person fails to be reliable your life comes crumbling down. Pick the right foundation.

> If you try to keep an idiot from making stupid mistakes you will soon become the second idiot.
> How could you succeed where repeated pain failed?

> If pain could not teach you, how could I?

> When noise from the outside falls silent, the mind turns to the next available source of it - itself.

> I am not beholden to circumstance as long as I can still act.

> A job is water shifting in your palm; your skills? The river’s source.

> You owe nothing but decency —  
>  and even that, you owe first to yourself.
